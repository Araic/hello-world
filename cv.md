####Summary
I am in my final year of Computer Applications in DCU. I love technology and I am very passionate about teaching it to others.
####Experience
######Intern, <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon.com, Inc.</a> <br>**February - September 2015**<br>
While on my 6 month internship as a Systems Engineer in Amazon, I developed a tool that gathered diagnostic information about a host machine remotely. The tool was written in Python and is used by the team I was working on to speed up the process of troubleshooting hosts. During my time in Amazon I also gained an insight into how websites work at a huge scale and Amazon's underlying distributed structure across it's network.<br>
######IT Service Desk, <a href="http://www.stvincents.ie/">St. Vincent's University Hospital</a> <br>**Summer 2014**<br>
In Vincents I worked on the IT Service Desk where I remotely troubleshooted problems from around the hospital. This experience strenghtened my problem solving skills and taught me a methodical approach which helped a lot with my 3rd Year Project. While there I also set up a series of SQL queries to pull information from their databases. 
######Freelance Work, <a href="http://www.webstop.ie/">Webstop Ltd.</a> <br>**2012-2014**<br>
In Webstop Ltd. was working with customers, it was quite a different atmosphere to working on service desks and it required a different skill set. During my time there I designed and built websites using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I also interacted with clients to understand what they needed on their sites and helped them to finalise the layout.<br>
######IT Service Desk, <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/">HSE</a><br>**Summer 2013**<br>
Working on the IT Service Desk in the HSE was the first time that I really got to help people on computers. It set the foundation for my job in Vincents. <br>
####Accomplishments/Interests
* I help girls at CoderDojo develop websites and work on coding projects with MIT AppInventor and Scratch, I have also volunteered at their events such as Coolest Projects.
* I tutored Higher level Leaving Cert Maths students for 2 years during college as part of an outreach programme.
* I lived in Austria for 4 months and looked after 3 children, teaching them English.<br>

####Projects
* In 3rd year of DCU I worked with a classmate to develop a  <a href="http://blogs.computing.dcu.ie/wordpress/mcaulec4/">chess style game</a> that used pathfinding
algorithms and was written in Java. 
* I am currently working on a programmable, voice controlled robotic car as part of my final year project. It uses a Raspberry Pi and is mainly programmed in Python. <br>
