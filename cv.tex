\section{Experience}
\begin{tabular}{rl}	
 \textsc{Feb - Sept} 2015 & \textbf{Systems Engineer Intern, Amazon} - Dublin, Ireland\\
& While on my 6 month internship as a Systems Engineer in Amazon, I developed a tool that\\
& gathered diagnostic information about a host machine remotely. The tool was written in\\
& Python and is used by the team I was working on to speed up the process of troubleshooting\\
& hosts. During my time in Amazon I also gained an insight into how websites work at a huge\\
& scale and Amazon's underlying distributed structure across it's network.\\
\textsc{Summer} 2014 & \textbf{IT Service Desk, St. Vincents} - Dublin, Ireland\\
& In Vincents I worked on the IT Service Desk where I remotely troubleshooted problems from\\ 
& around the hospital. This experience strengthened my problem solving skills and taught me\\ 
& a methodical approach which helped a lot with my 3rd Year Project. While there I also set\\
& up a series of SQL queries to pull information from their databases. \\
\textsc{2012-} 2014 & \textbf{Freelance Work, Webstop Ltd} - Kildare, Ireland\\
& In Webstop Ltd. was working with customers, it was quite a different atmosphere to working\\ 
& on service desks and it required a different skill set. During my time there I designed and \\
& built websites using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I also interacted with clients to understand\\
& what they needed on their sites and helped them to finalise the layout.\\
\textsc{Summer} 2013 & \textbf{IT Service Desk, HSE} - Dublin, Ireland \\
& Working on the IT Service Desk in the HSE was the first time that I really got to help\\
& people on computers. It set the foundation for my job in Vincents. \\
